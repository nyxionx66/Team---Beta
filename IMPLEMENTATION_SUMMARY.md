# Implementation Summary

## Features Implemented

### 1. Auto-Fetching Help Command
The help command now automatically discovers and displays all registered commands dynamically:

**Key Changes:**
- **Auto-Discovery**: The help command now automatically fetches all registered commands from the CommandManager
- **Dynamic Categories**: Shows all command categories with different colors automatically
- **Scalable**: New commands added to any category will automatically appear in help
- **Enhanced Display**: Shows total command count and category breakdown
- **Color-Coded Categories**: Each category gets a different color for better readability

**Features:**
- Automatically detects all registered command categories
- Displays commands organized by category with color coding
- Shows total command statistics (commands per category, total commands)
- Supports dynamic category naming (handles custom categories automatically)
- No manual maintenance required when adding new commands

**Before:**
- Help command showed only hardcoded categories (info, config, util)
- New commands in different categories wouldn't appear
- Static display with limited information

**After:**
- Automatically shows ALL registered commands across ALL categories
- Dynamic color coding for different categories
- Shows comprehensive statistics
- Fully scalable - no manual updates needed when adding commands

### 2. Screen-Aware Keybind System
Keybinds now only work when no screen is open (chat, inventory, pause menu, etc.):

**Key Changes:**
- **Screen Detection**: Added screen detection to prevent keybind activation when GUI is open
- **Safe Processing**: Keybinds are completely disabled when any screen is active
- **State Management**: Properly resets keybind states when screens open/close
- **Utility Methods**: Added helper methods for screen detection

**Features:**
- Keybinds disabled when chat is open
- Keybinds disabled when inventory is open  
- Keybinds disabled when pause menu is open
- Keybinds disabled for ANY screen/GUI
- Proper state reset to prevent unwanted activation
- Clean utility methods for screen detection

**Implementation Details:**
1. `KeybindUtil.shouldProcessKeybinds()` - Checks if any screen is open
2. `KeybindUtil.isInGame()` - Checks if player is fully in-game
3. `Keybind.update()` - Modified to check screen state before processing
4. `KeybindManager.onUpdate()` - Early return if screen is open

## Files Modified

### Command System:
- `/app/src/main/java/dev/mindle/team/command/impl/info/HelpCommand.java` - Enhanced help command
- `/app/src/main/java/dev/mindle/team/command/CommandManager.java` - Added test command registration
- `/app/src/main/java/dev/mindle/team/command/impl/util/TestCommand.java` - Added test command

### Keybind System:
- `/app/src/main/java/dev/mindle/team/module/keybind/Keybind.java` - Added screen detection
- `/app/src/main/java/dev/mindle/team/module/keybind/KeybindManager.java` - Enhanced with screen checking
- `/app/src/main/java/dev/mindle/team/util/KeybindUtil.java` - Added utility methods

## Testing

### Help Command:
1. Type `.help` in chat - should show all categories dynamically
2. Add new commands to any category - they should automatically appear
3. Try `.help <command>` for specific command help

### Keybinds:
1. Open chat (T key) - module keybinds should not work
2. Open inventory (E key) - module keybinds should not work  
3. Open pause menu (ESC) - module keybinds should not work
4. Close all screens - keybinds should work normally

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: No manual updates needed when adding commands
2. **User Experience**: Users see all available commands automatically
3. **Safety**: Keybinds won't interfere with GUI interactions
4. **Scalability**: System grows automatically with new commands
5. **Professional**: Clean, organized command display with statistics
